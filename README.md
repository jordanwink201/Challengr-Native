  This is the repo for the mobile app for our corresponding web front-end and API backend, which you can find [here](https://github.com/hacksquare/Challengr). The application is built with the awesome [React Native Framework](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) made by Facebook. React Native made it possible for us to write a mobile application nearly completely in JavaScript, while at the same time harnessing many of the native mobile features; Something that is not possible in most of the hybrid mobile SDK's like Ionic.
